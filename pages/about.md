Mercury Care Management helps families set-up and manage at-home care for their aging loved one. Partnering with businesses as an employee benefit, we connect families with a care transition manager who provides crisis level assistance to families after a major incident or lifestyle change for their elderly parent. By helping employees balance these personal responsibilities, employees can remain more focused at work and get back to work sooner.
