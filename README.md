# When going about making my website I forked a minimilist layout from LeNPaul/Millennial a free jekyll theme I found on jekyllthemes.io. When I went to jekyllthemes.io I found several example layouts (some paid) but after a few other attempts this one worked best for my needs. From there in regards to planning and design I already had an idea in mind. This year I created a startup around eldercare and hosted my website on Wix. Rather than paying a monthly fee, I decided to move my website from Wix onto github. My website for Wix can be found at mercurycaremanagement.com the inspiration for my website project. When transitioning my website from Wix to github I was also able to link the companies LinkedIn and my personal Georgetown.edu account.
